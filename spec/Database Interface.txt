== Query Information ==

The structure of a query is in basic as follows:

((function args*)*)

So in other words: A query is a list of functions.
Each function has its own set of possible arguments.

Logical:     and or not
Comparators: = != > >= < <= in !in matches

Logical functions expect one or more additional
functions as the body. Comparators expect two
arguments, the first being the field to compare
and the second being another field or a value to
compare against.

It is up to the implementation to offer additional
comparators or functions, although using them is
discouraged as it creates dependencies on a specific
implementation. How the standard comparators work for
different variable types is also left open to the
database implementation.

= Details =

- = -
Checks for equality between the two. This should
work between any of the same type, but the specifics
are up to the implementation.

- != -
Checks for inequality. Is basically the same as
(not (=))

- > - < - >= - <= -
Only really useful for number comparison.

- in -
Checks if the value of the field can be found in the
provided list.

- !in -
Basically the same as (not (in))

- matches -
Performs a regex match. What version of regex is
supported is up to the implementation.

== Constructing Queries ==

Queries can be constructed with the query macro.
Sample usage:

(query (and (= lastname "MÃ¼ller") (> points 10)))

The definition of the query macro is up to the
database implementation.
