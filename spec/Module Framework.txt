  === Module Framework Specification ===

0) radiance load -> searches for module.lisp files in mod/ and loads them.
1) module def -> expands into a defclass and defsystem call, with as much automation as possible.
   -> defsystem subclasses module class
2) system def -> shows all source files that need to be loaded.
3) source -> actual implementations.

fukken implementation problem, god damnit.
